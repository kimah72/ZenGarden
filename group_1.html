        <h1>Theme</h1>
        <p>The theme we choose is to have the page look more modern- similar to the "Screen Filler" that is on the CSS Zen Garden Page.
            We also wanted it to feel calm and more muted to give it a more Zen feel with the 
            combination of being organized and peaceful with the monochromatic color choice and layout.
